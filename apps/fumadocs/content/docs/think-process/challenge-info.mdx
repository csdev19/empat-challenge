# Challenge Info

## **Build Mini Virtual Speech Therapy Platform**

- Simple therapist/child video call session
  - You can use 3rd party library/service with free tier
- One basic interactive Phaser-based game (communication, language, or speech theme) with websocket sync, both child and SLP can play taking turns
- Basic session data recording by SLP (correct/incorrect trials, show % correct, subjective/behavioral notes)
- Simple student profile with progress visualization
- Caseload view: list of students under SLP, and their overall metrics
- No need to implement, but scaffold and indicate how would you implement:
  - End of session AI-generated session summary (using any LLM API) and on student profile: recent 3 sessions summary
- Deploy somewhere accessible for demo

## **Guidelines**

- Keep each feature simple/scrappy
- Focus on core functionality over polish
  - No expectation of perfection \- we want to see your thought process
- Use AI coding tools extensively, but review all generated code
- Document tradeoffs, non-fundamental refinements skipped, and non obvious assumptions in comments
- Build a sound technical foundation

**We're not looking for perfection \- we're looking for clean fundamentals, practical tradeoffs considerations / MVP thinking, and using AI effectively.**

## **Technical Requirements**

**Backend**: Node, TS  
**Frontend**: React, TS (shadcn-ui and tailwindcss preferred but not required)  
**Database**: NoSQL preferred, but Relational/PostgreSQL works  
**Real-time**: WebSockets for game synchronization  
**Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platform (Heroku, Vercel, Railway, etc.)

## **Deliverables**

1. **Working application** (deployed and accessible)
2. **Source code** (GitHub repository)
3. **Documentation** (README with setup, architecture notes, trade-offs)
4. **Demo video** (5-10 minutes showing key features)

## **Final Notes**

- Please don't hesitate to ask any questions at any time
- Please don’t work over the course of more than 7 days on this project, and let us know once you start working on it
  - Regular check-ins encouraged\! Reach out over email for async questions, and if useful [schedule live time](https://calendar.app.google/ffri8AiJ5LjpRDV78) during beginning, middle, and end of the project
- This is not a small project, we’re looking more into how you approach it (including design patterns, architecture, tradeoffs, shortcuts / creative solutions to challenges, comments/documentation) than you delivering everything
  - Make sure to deliver a working platform that captures the essence of the task: an effective (even if basic) platform for SLPs to deliver virtual therapy to kids
  - Prioritize fundamental features over completeness
- Please let us know when you start working on this, and send us what you achieve by end of day 7
  - Please let us know how much time you dedicated to it
- Have fun with the challenge and creative aspects\!

And remember: This is a showcase of your problem-solving approach and coding style, not a race to implement every possible feature.
